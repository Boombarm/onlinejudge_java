 * @Note:
software  Denis had the idea to create the following rank function.
f(T1,T2,...,TN) = c1T1 + c2T2 + ... + cNTN

used by Denis to rank his students in a contest is free of ties. In other words, it's not possible that two students get the first place in a same contest, or the second place, etc.
